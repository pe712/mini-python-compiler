possible features:

## switch statement
name = "Jack"
switch name:
    case "Alpha":
        print("It's me")
    case "Jack":
        print("it is jack")
    else: # or default ?
        print("not found")

use 
Ebinop(Binop.BEq, e1, e2)

Not groudbreaking but very effective again

## ++ and -- operators
Very simple but very effective

## list operations
 - building :
    a.append()
    a.remove(element)
    a.pop(index)
    a + b
 - slicing : a[1:15]
 - iterating : for x in a:
 - list comprehension (can be difficult):
    a = [2*x for x in a]
    a = [x for x in a if x>0]

## classes
Lot of work but probably interesting

## string formating
f-string and .format and %s

## functions
 - Built-in Memoization: Provide a built-in mechanism for memoization to optimize function calls by caching results for known input arguments.
 - overloading based on the number of args/dynamic type
 - optional arguments (args and kwargs)

## data structures
 - dict 


useful commands:

make
gcc -g test.s -o test_exe

bash ./test -v2 ./minipython
